# Dsl integration demo

Example of a communication process using Spring Integration components based on dsl.

The application reads a mail server every few seconds, and process the arrived mails according to the subject:
- "Confirmation - [number]", will be sent to a rabbit exchange (app creates automatically the exchange and a binding queue to store the messages).
- "Cancellation - [number]", will be sent to a ftp folder (the uploads folder is created locally under the docker folder).
- "Info Required - [number]", will be sent to a http service.
- Any other topic, will be sent to a custom service.

The workflow is described on the following diagram:
